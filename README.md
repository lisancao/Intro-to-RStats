# A Practical Introduction to R
Collection of scripts that can be used to do some basic statistical analyses and visualizations in R

These are currently not structured to be tutorials (though that may change!) but instead examples of usage with heavy comments. It is mostly a resource for me to keep a lot of the basics I learn centralized with familiar examples in case I need to go back and re-learn something.
